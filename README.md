&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer segmentation is used to segmented customer therefore we can classify the customer based on their behaviour, this customer segmentation usually used to help store to know how to treat their customers and know better about their customers, In this project I used machine learning which is clustering model to classify the customers.

# Dataset
